intellibins for GLASS

This repo is a redo version of https://github.com/intellibins/intellibins.

The glassware flow has changed and some features are added.

Hopefully, the code will be more oganized and readable.

We also adopt cutting-edge technologies such as [RxJava (Reactive)](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), [Dagger](http://square.github.io/dagger/) and [Groovy on Android](http://melix.github.io/blog/2014/06/grooid.html).
